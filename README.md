This is a port of [libcurl](https://curl.se/libcurl/) to WebAssembly for use in the browser. It provides an interface compatible with the [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API), allowing you to proxy HTTPS requests from the browser with full TLS encryption. Unlike previous implementations, the proxy server cannot read the contents of your requests.

## Building:
You can build this project by running the following commands:
```
git clone https://github.com/ading2210/libcurl.js --recursive
cd libcurl.js/client
./build.sh
```
Make sure you have emscripten, git, and the various C build tools installed. The only OS supported for building libcurl.js is Linux. On Debian-based systems, you can run the following command to install all the dependencies:
```
sudo apt install make cmake emscripten autoconf automake libtool pkg-config wget xxd jq
```

The build script will generate `client/out/libcurl.js` as well as `client/out/libcurl.mjs`, which is an ES6 module. You can supply the following arguments to the build script to control the build:
- `release` - Use all optimizations.
- `single_file` - Include the WASM binary in the outputted JS using base64. 
- `asan` - Use the Clang AddressSanitizer to catch possible memory bugs
- `all` - Build twice, once normally, and once as a single file.

Note: non-release builds will have the `-dev` version suffix and ASan builds will have the `-asan` suffix.

## Javascript API:

### Importing the Library:
To import the library, follow the build instructions in the previous section, and copy `client/out/libcurl.js` and `client/out/libcurl.wasm` to a directory of your choice. After the script is loaded, call `libcurl.load_wasm`, specifying the url of the `libcurl.wasm` file. You do not need to call `libcurl.load_wasm` if you use the `libcurl_full.js` file, as the WASM will be bundled into the JS file.

```html
<script defer src="./out/libcurl.js" onload="libcurl.load_wasm('/out/libcurl.wasm');"></script>
```

You may also call and await `libcurl.load_wasm` in your own async code. It returns a promise which resolves once libcurl.js is fully ready. If the WASM is already loaded, the function will return immediately. If the WASM loading fails, the promise will be rejected with an error message.
```js
async function main() {
  await libcurl.load_wasm("/out/libcurl.wasm");
  console.log(await libcurl.fetch("https://ading.dev/"));
}
main();
```
If you are using the single file version (`libcurl_full.js`), the `libcurl.load_wasm` function can still be used to wait for the WASM to load, although the url provided to it has no effect. 

Alternatively, prebuilt versions can be found on NPM and jsDelivr. You can use the [following URLs](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/libcurl.js@latest/) to load libcurl.js from a third party CDN.
```
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/libcurl.js@0.6.7/libcurl.js
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/libcurl.js@0.6.7/libcurl.wasm
```

To know when libcurl.js has finished loading, you can use the `libcurl_load` DOM event. The `libcurl_abort` event will trigger if the Emscripten runtime gets aborted due to a critical error. The `libcurl.events` object contains an `EventTarget` where these events will also be emitted. 
```js
document.addEventListener("libcurl_load", ()=>{
  libcurl.set_websocket(`wss://${location.hostname}/ws/`);
  console.log("libcurl.js ready!");
});
```

You may also use the `libcurl.onload` callback, which can be useful for running libcurl.js inside a web worker. 
```js
libcurl.onload = () => {
  console.log("libcurl.js ready!");
}
```

Once loaded, there will be a `window.libcurl` object which includes all the API functions. The `libcurl.ready` property can also be used to know if the WASM has loaded. 

There are also ES6 modules available if you are using a bundler. The `libcurl.mjs` and `libcurl_full.mjs` files provide this functionality, with the former being set as the entry point for the NPM package. 
```js
//import the regular version
import { libcurl } from "libcurl.js"; 

//import the version with the wasm included in the js
import { libcurl } from "libcurl.js/bundled"; 
```

Examples of running libcurl.js on the main thread and in a web worker are available at `client/index.html` and `client/worker.html` respectively. 

### Making HTTP Requests:
To perform HTTP requests, use `libcurl.fetch`, which takes the same arguments as the browser's regular `fetch` function. Like the standard Fetch API, `libcurl.fetch` will also return a `Response` object.
```js
let r = await libcurl.fetch("https://ading.dev");
console.log(await r.text());
```

Most of the standard Fetch API's features are supported, with the exception of:
- CORS enforcement
- Caching

Sending cookies is supported, but they will not be automatically sent unless you create a new HTTP session, which is covered in the next section.

The response may contain multiple HTTP headers with the same name, which the `Headers` object isn't able to properly represent. If this matters to you, use `response.raw_headers`, which is an array of key value pairs, instead of `response.headers`. There is support for streaming the response body using a `ReadableStream`, as well as canceling requests using an `AbortSignal`. All requests made using this method share the same connection pool, which has a limit of 50 active TCP connections (configurable if you use a separate HTTP session).

The `proxy` option may be used to specify the URL of a `socks5h`, `socks4a`, or `http` proxy server. For example `proxy: "socks5h://127.0.0.0:1080"` will set the proxy server for just the current request. This proxy option is separate from the global websocket proxy.

### Creating New HTTP Sessions:
To create new sessions for HTTP requests, use the `libcurl.HTTPSession` class. The constructor for this class takes the following arguments:
- `options` - An optional object with various settings.

The valid HTTP session settings are:
- `enable_cookies` - A boolean which indicate whether or not cookies should be persisted within the session.
- `cookie_jar` - A string containing the data in the cookie jar file. This should have been exported from a previous session. For more information on the format for this file, see the [curl documentation](https://curl.se/docs/http-cookies.html).
- `proxy` - A URL for a `socks5h`, `socks4a`, or `http` proxy server. 

Each HTTP session has the following methods available:
- `fetch` - Identical to the `libcurl.fetch` function but only creates connections in this session.
- `set_connections` - Set the connection limits. This takes three arguments: the first [is the hard limit of active connections](https://curl.se/libcurl/c/CURLMOPT_MAX_TOTAL_CONNECTIONS.html) (default 60), the second is [limit for the connection cache](https://curl.se/libcurl/c/CURLMOPT_MAXCONNECTS.html) (default 50), and the third is the [max connections per host](https://curl.se/libcurl/c/CURLMOPT_MAX_HOST_CONNECTIONS.html) (default 6).
- `export_cookies` - Export any cookies which were recorded in the session. This will return an empty string if cookies are disabled or no cookies have been set yet. 
- `close` - Close all connections and clean up the session. You must call this after you are done using the session, otherwise it will leak memory. 

The following attributes are supported:
- `base_url` - Set the base URL used to resolve relative URLs. If this is not defined then an error will be thrown when attempting to fetch a relative URL.

```js
let session = new libcurl.HTTPSession();
session.base_url = "https://ading.dev";
let r = await session.fetch("/projects/");
console.log(await r.text());
session.close();
```

### Creating WebSocket Connections:
To use WebSockets, create a `libcurl.CurlWebSocket` object, which takes the following arguments:
- `url` - The Websocket URL.
- `protocols` - A optional list of websocket subprotocols, as an array of strings.
- `options` - An optional object with extra settings to pass to curl.

The valid WebSocket options are:
- `headers` - HTTP request headers for the websocket handshake.
- `verbose` - A boolean flag that toggles the verbose libcurl output. This verbose output will be passed to the function defined in `libcurl.stderr`, which is `console.warn` by default.
- `proxy` - A URL for a `socks5h`, `socks4a`, or `http` proxy server. 

The following callbacks are available:
- `CurlWebSocket.onopen` - Called when the websocket is successfully connected.
- `CurlWebSocket.onmessage` - Called when a websocket message is received from the server. The data is passed to the first argument of the function, and it will be either a `Uint8Array` or a string, depending on the type of message.
- `CurlWebSocket.onclose` - Called when the websocket is cleanly closed with no error.
- `CurlWebSocket.onerror` - Called when the websocket encounters an unexpected error. The [error code](https://curl.se/libcurl/c/libcurl-errors.html) is passed to the first argument of the function.

The `CurlWebSocket.send` function can be used to send data to the websocket. The only argument is the data that is to be sent, which must be either a string or a `Uint8Array`. 

You can call `CurlWebSocket.close` to close and clean up the websocket.

```js
let ws = new libcurl.CurlWebSocket("wss://echo.websocket.in/", [], {verbose: 1});
ws.onopen = () => {
  console.log("ws connected!");
  ws.send("hello".repeat(100));
};
ws.onmessage = (data) => {
  console.log(data);
};
```

You can also use the `libcurl.WebSocket` object, which works identically to the regular [WebSocket](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSocket) object. It uses the same arguments as the simpler `CurlWebSocket` API.
```js
let ws = new libcurl.WebSocket("wss://echo.websocket.in/");
ws.addEventListener("open", () => {
  console.log("ws connected!");
  ws.send("hello".repeat(128));
});
ws.addEventListener("message", (event) => {
  console.log(event.data);
});
```

### Using TLS Sockets:
Raw TLS sockets can be created with the `libcurl.TLSSocket` class, which takes the following arguments:
- `host` - The hostname to connect to.
- `port` - The TCP port to connect to.
- `options` - An optional object with extra settings to pass to curl.

The valid TLS socket options are:
- `verbose` - A boolean flag that toggles the verbose libcurl output. 
- `proxy` - A URL for a `socks5h`, `socks4a`, or `http` proxy server. 

The callbacks work similarly to the `libcurl.CurlWebSocket` object, with the main difference being that the `onmessage` callback always returns a `Uint8Array`.

The `TLSSocket.send` function can be used to send data to the socket. The only argument is the data that is to be sent, which must be a `Uint8Array`. 

You can use the `TLSSocket.close` function to close the socket.

```js
let socket = new libcurl.TLSSocket("ading.dev", 443, {verbose: 1});
socket.onopen = () => {
  console.log("socket connected!");
  let str = "GET / HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: ading.dev\r\nConnection: close\r\n\r\n";
  socket.send(new TextEncoder().encode(str));
};
socket.onmessage = (data) => {
  console.log(new TextDecoder().decode(data));
};
```

### Changing the Network Transport:
You can change the underlying network transport by setting `libcurl.transport`. The following values are accepted:
- `"wisp"` - Use the [Wisp protocol](https://github.com/MercuryWorkshop/wisp-protocol). This is the default and the fastest option, since it multiplexes several TCP connections on the same websocket.
- `"wsproxy"` - Use the wsproxy protocol, where a new websocket is created for each TCP connection. For example, connecting to `wss://example.com/ading.dev:443` would open a new TCP connection to `ading.dev:443`.
- Any custom class - Use a custom network protocol. If you pass in custom code here, it must be roughly conformant with the standard `WebSocket` API. The URL that is passed into this fake websocket always looks like `"wss://example.com/ws/ading.dev:443"`, where `wss://example.com/ws/` is the proxy server URL, and `ading.dev:443` is the destination server.

### Changing the Websocket Proxy URL:
You can change the URL of the websocket proxy by using `libcurl.set_websocket`.
```js
libcurl.set_websocket("ws://localhost:6001/");
```
If the websocket proxy URL is not set and one of the other API functions is called, an error will be thrown. Note that this URL must end with a trailing slash.

Changing the websocket proxy URL will not close any existing connections.

### Getting Libcurl's Output:
If you want more information about a connection, you can pass the `_libcurl_verbose` argument to the `libcurl.fetch` function. These are the same messages that you would see if you ran `curl -v` on the command line.
```js
await libcurl.fetch("https://example.com", {_libcurl_verbose: 1});
```

By default this will print the output to the browser console, but you can set `libcurl.stdout` and `libcurl.stderr` to intercept these messages. This callback will be executed on every line of text that libcurl outputs.
```js
libcurl.stderr = (text) => {document.body.innerHTML += text};
```

Libcurl.js will also output some error messages to the browser console. You can intercept these messages by setting the `libcurl.logger` callback, which takes two arguments:
- `type` - The type of message. This will be one of the following: `"log"`, `"warn"`, `"error"`
- `text` - The text that is to be logged.

This may be useful if you are running libcurl.js inside a web worker and do not have access to the regular console API.

### Getting Error Strings:
Libcurl.js reports errors based on the [error codes](https://curl.se/libcurl/c/libcurl-errors.html) defined by the libcurl C library. The `libcurl.get_error_string` function can be used to get an error string from an error code. 

```js
console.log(libcurl.get_error_string(56));
//"Failure when receiving data from the peer"
```

### Getting Version Info:
You can get version information from the `libcurl.version` object. This object will also contain the versions of all the C libraries that libcurl.js uses. `libcurl.version.lib` returns the version of libcurl.js itself. 

### Getting the CA Certificates Bundle:
You can get the CA cert bundle that libcurl uses by calling `libcurl.get_cacert`. The function will return a string with the certificates in PEM format. The cert bundle comes from the [official curl website](https://curl.se/docs/caextract.html), which is extracted from the Mozilla Firefox source code. 

### Using the Wisp Client
The `libcurl.wisp` object exposes all of the APIs from [wisp-client-js](https://github.com/MercuryWorkshop/wisp-client-js). This API is not guaranteed to be stable. 

## Proxy Server:
The proxy server consists of a standard [Wisp](https://github.com/MercuryWorkshop/wisp-protocol) server, allowing multiple TCP connections to share the same websocket.

To host the proxy server, run the following commands:
```
git clone https://github.com/ading2210/libcurl.js --recursive
cd libcurl.js
server/run.sh --static=./client
```

For a full list of server arguments, see the [wisp-server-python documentation](https://github.com/MercuryWorkshop/wisp-server-python).
